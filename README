Steps to start program:

Make sure you have an environment variable with your github token:

export GIT_ORG_DASHBOARD_API_TOKEN="[YOUR GITHUB API TOKEN]"

Open three terminals and do the following
1. Activate venv: . venv/bin/activate
2. python3 [git_fetching_service.py | db_service.py |  web_server_service.py] respectively
(one in each terminal)
3. Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/org/[organization-name]

I used a micro services approach in architecting this web app. Separate services for the
web server that interfaces with the UI, a service for database interactions (find and insert),
and one for fetching data from the github api. Each separate service can be scaled according
to usage in production. They all operate separately from one another.

Note for future improvement (due to time constraints):
    The sorting done in web_server_service.py is not ideal. Two solutions come to mind.
    The first is have another micro service that grabs the data from the db and sorts it.
    Another is to design the db in an easy way and perform .sort() on the mongo finds.
    I ran out of time to do the latter but would have tried that first.
